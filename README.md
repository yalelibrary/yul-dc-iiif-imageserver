# Image ID and lookup

## Key prefix

All image keys are prefixed with `ptiffs`

## Pairtree

Identifiers are assumed to be numeric OIDs.  Last 2 digits are placed first for randomness.  If the OID is made up of an odd number of digits, the final digit is ignored when constructing the pairtree path.  

For example:

OID `12345` results in `/ptiffs/45/12/34/12345.tif`

OID `123456` results in `/ptiffs/56/12/34/56/123456.tif`

## Image type

Assumes images are TIFF and end with the `.tif` extension.
